# monkeylang
This is a Rust implementation of the Monkey language, an interpreted academic language from the [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/) book.

This repository exists only for the sake of experimentation: I've always wanted to write an interpreter and go deep inside language parsing and ASTs. Plus, I want to improve my skills in Rust. As such, do not assume everything is this repository is formally correct nor idiomatic, although I try my best to keep my standards high.
